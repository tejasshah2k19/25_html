    <font size="+2">
        Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field, at the centre of which is
        a
        22-yard (20-metre; 66-foot) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails (small sticks) balanced
        on
        three stumps. Two players from the batting team, the striker and nonstriker, stand in front of either wicket
        holding
        bats, while one player from the fielding team, the bowler, bowls the ball toward the striker's wicket from the
        opposite end of the pitch. The striker's goal is to hit the bowled ball with the bat and then switch places with
        the
        nonstriker, with the batting team scoring one run for each of these exchanges. Runs are also scored when the
        ball
        reaches the boundary of the field or when the ball is bowled illegally.
        <br><br>
        The fielding team aims to prevent runs by dismissing batters (so they are "out"). Dismissal can occur in various
        ways, including being bowled (when the ball hits the striker's wicket and dislodges the bails), and by the
        fielding
        side either catching the ball after it is hit by the bat but before it hits the ground, or hitting a wicket with
        the
        ball before a batter can cross the crease line in front of the wicket. When ten batters have been dismissed, the
        innings (playing phase) ends and the teams swap roles. Forms of cricket range from traditional Test matches
        played
        over five days to the newer Twenty20 format (also known as T20), in which each team bats for a single innings of
        20
        overs (each "over" being a set of 6 fair opportunities for the batting team to score) and the game generally
        lasts
        three to four hours.
